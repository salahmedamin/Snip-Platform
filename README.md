<strong>Snip is a platform made for people who want to read/write.</strong><br>
In short, it's for people who are fond of books, but their community groups face issues because of restrictions set by group holders.<br>
Everything is allowed here, ART, BOOKS, CRITICIZING... respect is the only required thing.
